# Create a project[Â¶](#create-a-project "Permanent link")

Most Truffle commands require that you run them against an existing
Truffle project. So the first step is to create a Truffle project.

You can create a bare project, but for those just getting started, you
can use [Truffle Boxes](/boxes), which are example applications and
project templates. We\'ll use the [MetaCoin box](/boxes/metacoin), which
creates a token that can be transferred between accounts:

1.  Create a new directory for your Truffle project:

<div>

``` {#__code_1}
mkdir MetaCoin
cd MetaCoin
```

</div>

1.  Download (\"unbox\") the MetaCoin box:

<div>

``` {#__code_2}
truffle unbox metacoin
```

</div>

**Note**: You can use the `truffle unbox <box-name>` command to download
any of the other [Truffle Boxes](/boxes).

**Note**: To create a bare Truffle project with no smart contracts
included, use `truffle init`.

**Note**: You can use an optional `--force` to initialize the project in
the current directory regardless of its state (e.g. even if it contains
other files or directories). This applies to both the \`init\` and
\`unbox\` commands. Be careful, this will potentially overwrite files
that exist in the directory.

Once this operation is completed, you\'ll now have a project structure
with the following items:

-   `contracts/`: Directory for [Solidity
    contracts](/docs/truffle/getting-started/interacting-with-your-contracts)
-   `migrations/`: Directory for [scriptable deployment
    files](/docs/truffle/getting-started/running-migrations#migration-files)
-   `test/`: Directory for test files for [testing your application and
    contracts](/docs/truffle/testing/testing-your-contracts)
-   `truffle-config.js`: Truffle [configuration
    file](/docs/truffle/reference/configuration)
